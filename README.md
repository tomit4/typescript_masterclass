## Net Ninja's TypeScript Masterclass

This is a following along of [Net Ninja's TypeScript Masterclass](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=net+ninja+typescript+masterclass).

Note that as of 11/18/2023, this playlist is not yet complete, so go to his [Github Repo](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/typescript-masterclass) to follow along if you wish to jump ahead.

Should you jump ahead, make sure to find additional resources as his files are
bare bones.

You left off [here](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/typescript-masterclass/tree/lesson-32/src)
NOTE: At lesson 32, he starts to build a full stack app, but there isn't much TS
at the beginning, just copy the files until he gets to working with TS.

Note that you created a script that will set up the most bare bones tsc setup.
Once you've created the directory, just invoke:

```
tsc-i
```

**NOTE:**

As you go through this, if you find a tsconfig.json flag you think should be on
by default, append that flag change to the tsconfig.json file in this directory
(./tsconfig.json). After tutorial series is over, copy this tsconfig.json to
your notes repo
